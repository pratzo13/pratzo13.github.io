  title: Done with the first draft
  layout: post

5 months of the sabbatical just flew by. There was so much I did during these months, but most importantly, I complete my first draft!

To say that I was relieved would be an understatement. I had bet too much on this, and at a point I was worried that at the end of the time off, I would have nothing to show for it. It took some extreme hardwork, focus and determination to get the first draft done. And surprisingly, the major chunk of it was done in the last month.
