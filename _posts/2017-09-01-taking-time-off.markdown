The idea of Divnity was brewing in my head for a while. I had formed characters in my head, and come up with cool scenes that appealed to me. I just had to sit down and bring it all together, while adding substance to it.

I finally decided that I needed time off to do this, and only this, if I was to complete my first draft. It was a daunting task, taking a sabbatical, but I decided that I had to give myself a chance. This might sting me, but the regret of not doing it may later sting me in life much worse.

I took 5 months off work, from October 2017 to the end of February 2018. This sabbatical was going to derail my career path by at least a year, but I was mentally prepared for it. I knew what was at stake, and was prepared to make the sacrifices required. I put in the sabbatical request, and my journey effectively started from the first of October 2017.
