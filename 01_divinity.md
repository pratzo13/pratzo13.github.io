  <b>His own dreams had become a prison from which there was no escape.</b>
</p>

<p>
  Avi joins the best detective in town as an assistant to put his oddities to good use. Because of these oddities, which Avi keeps under wraps, he has always believed that he is alone. That is, until his first day at a murder investigation where he meets Kabir - the man who may have the answers that Avi has been seeking all his life.

  Catching a vicious killer on the loose stops looking like the biggest problem at hand when Aviâ€™s dreams start being invaded by a dark presence, threatening to drive him insane.
</p>

<p>
  With countless lives at stake, Avi must decide which threat to face - the serial killer responsible for the numerous deaths, or the rogue entity that is wreaking havoc in the mysterious dream world.
