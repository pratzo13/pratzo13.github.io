Prateek Srivastava is a software developer living in Bangalore, who likes writing fiction and fantasy. He draws inspiration from visiting new places and meeting new people, and weaves them into his stories. He is also a foosball, table tennis and nap enthusiast.

He grew up reading fiction novels by authors like Jeffrey Archer, JK Rowling, Christopher Paolini, and a few one hit authors as well. Lately, he moved to the fantasy genre, and enjoyed it immensely.

He had the Divinity story in mind for a while, and finally took some time off to write it to completion. While he enjoys his work as a software developer, he enjoys writing more. Extending his imagination simply feels more fulfilling to him. He is hopeful that his first book would help him open the gateway, allowing him to write many more stories.
