I"Ã<p>Prateek Srivastava was born on the 13th of January 1990 in Gorakhpur, UP (India). He spent most of his childhood living in different parts of the country because of his fatherâ€™s moving job. Meeting new people and experiencing different cultures helped him foster a curious and imaginative mind.</p>

<p>As a child, his sister cultivated in him the love for books and reading. He grew up reading fiction novels by authors like Jeffrey Archer, JK Rowling and Christopher Paolini, to name a few. Some time later, the fantasy genre caught his interest and he has been in love with it ever since.</p>

<p>Prateek graduated in Information Technology and works as a Software Developer in one of Indiaâ€™s biggest IT companies. The story of Divinity had been stewing in his mind for a while, and he finally chalked out some time to tell the story to the world. He hopes that Divinity opens the doors to a much richer, homegrown genre of fantasy novels in India.</p>
