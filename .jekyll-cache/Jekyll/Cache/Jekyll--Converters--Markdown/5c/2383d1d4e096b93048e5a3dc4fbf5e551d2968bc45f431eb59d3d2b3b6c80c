I"r<p>5 months of the sabbatical just flew by. There was a lot that I did during these months, but most importantly, I completed my first draft!</p>

<p>It took some extreme hardwork, focus and determination to get the first draft done. And surprisingly, the major chunk of it was done in the last month. To say that I was relieved would be an understatement. I had bet too much on this, and at a point during the break I was worried that at the end, I would have nothing to show for it.</p>

<p>Holding the complete first draft in my hands, at the end of the 5 months, made me feel ecstatic. I had crossed the first hurdle!</p>
