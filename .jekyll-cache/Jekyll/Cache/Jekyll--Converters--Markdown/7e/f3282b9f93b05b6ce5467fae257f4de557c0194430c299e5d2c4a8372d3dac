I"›<p>The idea of Divinity was brewing in my head for a while. I had formed the characters in my head, thought of an intriguing setting, and come up with riveting scenes that appealed to me. I just had to sit down, and bring it all together.</p>

<p>I finally decided that I needed time off to write, and only write, if I was to complete my first draft. It was a daunting task to take a sabbatical, but I had to give myself a chance to do this. I did not want any regrets later in life, especially since I believed that Divinity as a story had great potential.</p>

<p>I took 5 months off work, from October to February. This break was going to hamper my career growth in Software Development by at least a year, but I was mentally prepared for it. I knew what was at stake, and I was prepared to make the sacrifices it required. I put in the sabbatical request, and my journey started from the first day of October 2017.</p>
